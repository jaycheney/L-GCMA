# L-GCMA

## Overview
This is an official PyTorch implementation of Label-Guided Cross-Modal Attention Network for Multi-Label Aerial Image Classification.

## Contents
* **rs_sentence_embedding.py**: This script is responsible for producing sentence BERT embeddings.
* **bert.npy**: This file contains the result of sentence embedding generated by the rs_sentence_embedding.py script.

Please note that additional code will be published and organized in the near future.

## Usage
To use the L-GCMA implementation, follow the steps below:

1. Run the `rs_sentence_embedding.py` script to generate sentence BERT embeddings.
2. Utilize the resulting embeddings for multi-label aerial image classification tasks.
